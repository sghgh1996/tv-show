## Components

- We have common components like buttons, inputs, ... and layout components which are used in different layouts like footer and header. We use component icons with svg and we have page-specific components inside the pages folder.


- Components in this folder are auto-registered and on-demand, powered by [`unplugin-vue-components`](https://github.com/antfu/unplugin-vue-components).
